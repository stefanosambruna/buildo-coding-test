Buildo Coding Test

In order to run the RESTful Web Service locally you need to:
   - Build the jar file out of the Spring Boot application. Run the command "mvn clean package" inside the root folder. This process will generate the jar file (called api-0.0.1.jar) inside the target folder. During this process all the tests get executed and if even only one fails an error gets thrown.
   - Get inside the target folder
   - Run the Spring Boot application with the command "java -jar api-0.0.1.jar"
